# Todo list

## 0.2:

- 13 and 14 could be swapped, randomized or otherwise modified so they are not exactly as in the book.
- 15 could be modified further.  Maybe even randomized?

## 0.3:
* Randomize 23.
* Make 28 and 30 into webwork (even if not randomized).

## 0.4:
* Randomize 1.

## 1.1:
- Make last problem into ww.

## 1.7:
- 2 can be made into a randomized mc problem easily.

## 2.1:

In general, this section needs more WW.  Even if I make up brand new problems, there need to be some.  Perhaps as simple as asking for a_8 for recursive or closed formulas.

* Problem 3 as ww?.
* And 4.  Webwork can do sequences.  Look at 2.2.2 as example.
* None of these appear to be randomized/different.  Do some!

## 2.3:
- Problem 5 could be made into ww as follows: Find a sequence with a_0 = 1 and second difference...., what is a_5?

## 2.4:
- lots still need to be randomized

## 2.6:
- Only first three problems are randomized.
