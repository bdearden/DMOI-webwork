# DMOI WeBWorK

A collection of original WeBWorK problems to accompany Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction by Oscar Levin.

Most of these problems are available on [edfinity](https://edfinity.com/) if you would like to use them for your WeBWorK hosting.  Alternatively, you can upload the zip of this repository to your WeBWorK server, or import individual problems as needed.

Very soon, these problems will be included in the Contrib folder of WeBWorK, and eventually, be included in the Open Problem Library, pending editor approval.
