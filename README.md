# DMOI WeBWorK

A collection of original WeBWorK problems to accompany Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction by Oscar Levin.

## Organization

Problems that are working and classroom ready are located in the DMOI folder (which will be zipped for distribution).  Problems that are still under development are stored in the "In Progress" folder.

Working problems come in three varieties.  

- A good number of problems have been "randomized" so that different students will (likely) see different versions of the problem.  These can be identified by the lack of any suffix on their file name (they are named 2.1.4.pg, for the 4th problem of section 1 of chapter 2).
- Some problems are not randomized like this, either because doing so is difficult, or I just haven't gotten around to it.  These are still machine gradable, and an effort has been made to make the version of the problem not identical to that of the textbook when the textbook has a solution available.  These problems are marked with a "-nr" suffix (so 2.1.4-nr.pg).
- Many more problems are simply not the type of problem that WeBWorK could grade.  Perhaps students are asked to explain why a statement is true, or write a proof, or enumerate all outcomes, or draw a graph.  These problems are still included, but as "essay" questions.  The question, as it appears in the book, is included and students will be given an essay box that an instructor must grade manually.  Such problems are marked by the "-essay" suffix (2.1.4-essay.pg).

Sections and chapters that only contain essay questions have their folder marked as such.

## Access

Most of these problems are available on [edfinity](https://edfinity.com/) if you would like to use them for your WeBWorK hosting.  Alternatively, you can upload the zip of this repository to your WeBWorK server, or import individual problems as needed.

Very soon, these problems will be included in the Contrib folder of WeBWorK, and eventually, be included in the Open Problem Library, pending editor approval.
